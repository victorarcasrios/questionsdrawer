This project is just a Laravel 5 API RESTFUL application to answer the http requests of the Android app
with the same name, made both as my DAM (Multiplatform Applications Development) final course project.
Feel free to read or use all the code for non profit purposes like learning a bit of Laravel 5 Framework, have a look to make yourself an idea of how an API RESTFUL script looks like, or re-use the parts of the code you want for develope more open-sourced software.
